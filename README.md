# Attrition-Analysis
The provided dashboard offers valuable insights into employee attrition and related metrics. It highlights variations in average salaries across departments, with Sales having the highest (\$6,959.2) and R&D the lowest (\$6,281.3). Attrition seems higher among employees living farther from work and those with lower job satisfaction. Business travel is primarily observed in R&D and Sales, while attrition patterns also vary based on marital status and gender. The data shows a correlation between higher education levels and higher average income, with Masterâ€™s Degree holders earning the most (\$6,832). Additionally, attrition rates differ significantly across departments, job roles, and gender, with managers appearing to have lower attrition. 

From this analysis, several KPIs can be derived, such as average salary by department, attrition rate by distance and job satisfaction, income by education level, and attrition rates segmented by gender, marital status, job role, and department. Working with Tableau to create such dashboards helps develop essential skills like data visualization, advanced analytics, KPI development, and storytelling with data. It also enables the use of filters and calculated fields to gain focused insights and create interactive, user-friendly dashboards. These skills are crucial for integrating insights into decision-making processes, addressing business challenges like high attrition, and effectively communicating findings to stakeholders.
